# Welcome to my LLM Projects!

This repository is dedicated to my journey in exploring and building projects centered around large language models (LLMs). Each project here is designed to deepen my understanding of LLMs and their practical, real-world applications.

## Current Projects

#### `GitHub PR Description Generation Bot` 

This is my very first LLM project! The goal of this project is to create a bot capable of analyzing a GitHub Pull Request's (PR) code diff—along with additional context if needed—and automatically updating the PR's description with clear and concise documentation.

#### `Other Ideas`

This folder serves as a living repository for brainstorming and capturing ideas for future LLM projects.
