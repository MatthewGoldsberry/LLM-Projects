I first tried the Meta Llama 3.1 8GB version. I suspect that 8B is way to big for my laptops hardware as for a simple prompt of just "Who are you" it took 20 minutes. So with that I am going to rethink the size of the LLM and jump down the a 1B version of Llama. 

The 1B version works in a quicker manner and has ok performance so that will be used.
